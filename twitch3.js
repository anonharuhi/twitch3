At 04:41, Maitoz asks "Are you sure she's single?", referring to the asian woaman at DreamHack. When Perplexity confirms, Maitoz calls for the Light of Elune/Sapper play, which means Light will be used at this moment (again, it is a unique quest reward and Alliance can only get 1 per character). He then says "Nifty", referring to Nifty Stopwatch, a level 40ish quest reward trinket from the Badlands that increases run speed by 40% for 10 seconds. Many people don't know this item even exists or don't understand it's importance in mass World PvP, but it is essential and is often paired up with Free Action Potions to reach an enemy's backline as quickly as possible. Good call that gets the raid to the Horde priests ASAP and gets rid of their dispelers/healers.
